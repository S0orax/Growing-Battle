#Growing Battle

##Description

First ! You need to be 2.

Growing Battle is a game made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare (it's a game jam).
It's a local multiplayer platformer, I was inspired by <a href="http://www.nidhogggame.com/">Nidhogg</a>.

##How to play

You can find the game on <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=15933">Ludum Dare site</a>
or on <a href="http://sorax.itch.io/growing-battle">itchio</a></br>
The controls are :</br>
Player 1 |Â Player 2 |</br>
  ZQSD	|	ARROW	    : to move</br>
  SPACE	|	CONTROL		: to attack</br>
  
PS : I recommend to read the rules when you launch the game with the 'R' key
